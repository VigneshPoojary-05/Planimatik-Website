üåêPlanimatik Clone: A Self-Built Replication

This repository showcases my independent development skills through a meticulous clone of the Planimatik website. Every line of HTML and CSS was written by hand, entirely from scratch, without external guidance from tutorials or AI. This project served as a rigorous test of my ability to:

‚Ä¢ Deconstruct and Rebuild Complex Layouts: Successfully replicated the intricate section layouts and content organization of the original site.
‚Ä¢ Master CSS for Visual Fidelity: Achieved visual accuracy by independently implementing advanced CSS properties for spacing, typography, responsiveness, and interactive elements (like button hover effects and the navigation slider in the shipper section).
‚Ä¢ Structure Semantic HTML: Created a well-organized and semantic HTML structure to ensure accessibility and maintainability.
‚Ä¢ Manage Assets: Integrated images and external fonts effectively to match the original design.

This was a challenging yet highly rewarding project that significantly enhanced my practical front-end development expertise.
